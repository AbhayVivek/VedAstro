Notes On Gochara Prediction in Muhurtha (from book ) - 11/2/2022

- Built on reference to, Hindu Predictive Astrology pg. 254

- Asthavarga bindus are not yet account for, asthavarga good or bad nature of the planet.
  It is assumed that Shadbala system can compensate for it.

- This passage on page 255 needs to be clarified
"It must be noted that when passing through the first 10
degrees of a sign, Mars and the Sun produce results."

- It's intepreted that Vendha is an obstruction and not a reversal of the Gochara results
  So as for now the design is that if a vedha is present than the result is simply nullified.

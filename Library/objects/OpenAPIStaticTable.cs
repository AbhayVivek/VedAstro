All these states refer to the position or residence of the planet and as such a certain degree of strength or weakness attends on it. This strength or potency is known as the Sthanabala. 1.Uccha Bala Uccha means exaltation. When a planet is placed in its highest exaltation point it is of full strength and when it is in its deepest debilitation point it is devoid of any strength. When in between the strength is calculated proportionately dependent on the distance these planets are placed from the highest exaltation or deepest debilitation point. 2.Sapta Vargiya Bala Rashi Hora Drekkana Saptamsha Navamsha Dwadasamsha and Trimsamsha constitute the Sapta Varga. The strength of the planets in these seven divisional charts based on their placements in Mulatrikona own sign friendly sign etc. constitute the Sapta vargiya bala. 3.OjaYugma RashiAmsha Bala Oja means odd signs and Yugma means even signs. Thus as the name imply this strength is derived from a planets placement in the odd or even signs in the Rashi and Navamsha. 4.Kendradi Bala The name itself implies how to compute this strength. A planet in a Kendra 14710 gets full strength while one in Panapara 25811 gets half and the one in Apoklimas 12369 gets quarter strength. 5.Drekkana Bala Due to placement in first second or third Drekkana of a sign male female and hermaphrodite planets respectively get a quarter strength according to placements in the first second and third Drekkana.

                1. For instance
                political success may be predicted in the Dasa of the Sun, if
                he is in Aries in the 10th house. This political success will be
                at its maximum provided the Sun is not aspecled by malefics
                and his position is equally strong in the Navamsa. If he is
                aspected by Saturn who may be in Aquarius, then in spite of
                the Sun being in Aries, complete political success cannot be
                and ought not to be predicted.

                2. The Dasa results stand to be modified by the effect of
                Gochara or transiting planets.

                  <li class=""list-group-item"">
                3. If the lord is well placed as already explained above,
                be will do good regarding the house or houses with which he
                may have anything to do either by way of ownership or aspect
                or location during his period. while if the lord is weak and ill placed,
                he will inflict misery.

                  <li class=""list-group-item"">
                4. The lord of the Dasa has a quality of his own stamped
                upon him. This will again be modified by the nature of the
                house, the nature of the sign, the nature of the aspecting
                bodies, the nature of the lord of the constellation the Dasa
                lord is in, the favourable and unfavourable situation of the
                lord of Dasa in the Navamsa
                </li>
                  <li class=""list-group-item"">
                5. ln the course of a Dasa, a planet produces such results
                as it indicates by virtue of ownership, association, location
                and aspect. For instance, favourable position of the lord of
                the 2nd will give good income and wealth during his Dasa.

                  <li class=""list-group-item"">
                6. The general effect of the Dasa (major period) get
                    modified by the planet that rules the particular Bhukti (subperiod).
                    In such a case, however, the influences of both the
                    planets are to be compounded and the relation between them
                    taken into account

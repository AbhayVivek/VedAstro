        <h4 class="fw-bold">Reason</h4>
        <p class="text-justify" style="max-width:@AppData.MaxContentWidthPx">
        Anybody who has studied Vedic Astrology knows well how accurate it can be.
        But also how complex it can get to make accurate predictions.
        It takes decades of experience to be able make accurate prediction.
        As such this knowledge only reaches a limited people.
        This project is an effort to change that.
    </p>

    <h4 class="fw-bold">Goal</h4>
    <p class="text-justify" style="max-width:@AppData.MaxContentWidthPx;">
        Our goal is to make Vedic Astrology easily accessible to anybody.
        So that people can use it in their daily life for their benefit.
        Vedic Astrology in Sanskrit mean "Light". And that is exactly what it is.
        It lights our future so we can see it in advance.
        And it lights our past, to understand our mistakes.

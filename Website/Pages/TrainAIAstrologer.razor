                Using vedic astrology data as start point, we create a table of predictions for different aspects a human life.
                For now we take 12 aspects, representing the 12 houses. These is not limited to 12 and it will be expanded.
                During this process, we assume the data being fed into the model 100% is accurate. This is necessary in the begging.
                Then we use that trained model to make predictions for a new person not in the data set.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                These prediction is then further improved by humans. This is where we take ML training collected from people all over the world
                into one data-set. Allowing the creation of an <strong>AI Astrologer</strong>. With time and continues improvement this tool holds
                great potential for the benefit of all people.

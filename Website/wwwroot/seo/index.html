        Which to the mortal man is invisible in action, and only visible in its reaction.

    <h2>About : reason and goal for this project</h2>
    <p>
        Anybody who has studied Vedic Astrology knows well how accurate it can be. But also how complex it can get to make accurate predictions. It takes decades of experience to be able make accurate prediction. As such this knowledge only reaches a limited people. This project is an effort to change that.
        Our goal is to make Vedic Astrology easily accessible to anybody. So that people can use it in their daily lives for their benefit. Vedic Astrology in Sanskrit mean "Light". And that is exactly what it is. It lights our future so we can change it. And it lights our past, to understand our mistakes.
        By using modern computational technologies & methods we can simplify the complexity of Vedic Astrology. For example, calculating planet strength (Bhava Bala) used to take hours, now with computers we can calculate it in milliseconds. And using databases & innovative programming methods, there is no need to remember thousands of planetary combinations, allowing you to make accurate predictions with little to no knowledge.
